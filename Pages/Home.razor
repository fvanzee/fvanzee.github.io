                <br />
                I am a seasoned software developer with over 15 years of experience.

                <br />
                My expertise spans a diverse range of technologies, focused around advanced web development. I have
                collaborated with clients across various industries, including industrial automation, warehouse systems,
                e-commerce, and sports.
                <br />
                <br />
                In recent years, my focus has been on backend development for web applications, encompassing API design,
                infrastructure setup, and DevOps workflows. I have extensive experience with major cloud platforms and
                frequently implement cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes.
                <br />
                <br />
                In my personal projects, I have been exploring my passion for developing applications in Rust.
                <br />
                <br />
                I take pride in working closely with clients and stakeholders to deliver tailored solutions that meet
                their needs.
